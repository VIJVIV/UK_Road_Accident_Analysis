# UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard created in Power BI aims to present the KPI's associated with analyzing road accidents that have occured in the UK in the year of 2021 and 2022. For the purpose of analysis, 2022 has been referred to as CY (Current Year) and 2021 as PY (Previous Year). The representation of primary and secondary KPI's illustrated in the dashboard aim to provide key insights to stakeholders with regards to analyzing the number and severity of casualties (CY and the % change from PY), the types and factors involved in these casualties, and also the location of the casualties. This analysis hence aims provide direction to the relvant stakeholders in terms of further reducing the number and severity of casualties, and to enable safer road infrastructure in the UK.
