# UK Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

This dashboard created in Power BI aims to visualize the KPI's associated with analyzing road accidents and casualties that have occured in the UK in 2021 and 2022. For the purpose of this analysis, 2022 has been referred to as CY (Current Year) and 2021 as PY (Previous Year). The representation of primary and secondary KPI's illustrated in the dashboard aim to provide key insights to relavant stakeholders (ex. road & traffic departments) with regards to analyzing the number and severity of accidents & casualties (CY and the % change from PY), the effect of different factors involved in these casualties, and also the time & location of these casualties. This analysis ultimately aims to provide direction to the relvant stakeholders in terms of further reducing the number and severity of accidents & casualties, and enabling safer road infrastructure in the UK.
